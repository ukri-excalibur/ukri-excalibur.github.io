			## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who can apply for funding from ExCALIBUR H&ES?

We expect that proposals will be led by UK universities or public sector research establishments.

### Who can be a partner on an ExCALIBUR H&ES case for support?

There are no restrictions on who you can partner with, however funds can normally only be disbursed to UK based organisations. We are particularly keen to see collaborations with ExCALIBUR working groups and technology providers.

### What kind of collaborations do you anticipate?

We expect that ExCALIBUR H&ES projects will generally include Research Software Engineering (RSE) effort, and that the people in these roles will work closely with the ExCALIBUR working groups that aim to make use of the testbeds. We are also keen to see deep engagement with technology providers on next generation hardware and software such as pre-release and pre-commercial hardware and developer tools.

### What can I request funding for in my case for support?

ExCALIBUR H&ES is only able to fund capital expenditure, however this can include bought-out staff time to work on your project, e.g. RSE or Research Operations (ResOps) effort.

### What is the timeframe for my grant if my case for support is successful?

Grants will be awarded for the following financial (tax) year, so for example awards from the September 2020 call will go live in April 2021.

### How can I submit a proposal?

We will be running a series of open calls through the lifetime of the ExCALIBUR H&ES project. The first of these runs from September 14th 2020 to October 19th 2020. You can only submit a proposal during the open call period

### Who do I send my case for support to?

Please send your completed case for support template to the ExCALIBUR H&ES [programme office](mailto:excalibur-hes@jiscmail.ac.uk?subject=ExCALIBUR%20HES%20website%20enquiry). You are welcome to contact the programme office for formative feedback before submission.

### What does the review process for submissions look like?

The proposals received during each open call period will be reviewed by an expert panel with academic and industry expertise. You will receive written feedback on your proposal, and may be invited to present your case for support to the panel. You may be invited to revise and resubmit your proposal in response to panel feedback.

### How will the ExCALIBUR H&ES grant be awarded?

Grants will be issued through UKRI in the normal manner. At the point where the final project details and budget have been agreed for a successful submission, you will be required to document via Je-S so that a grant letter can be issued.

### Who will have access to the testbeds that ExCALIBUR H&ES creates?

ExCALIBUR projects will have priority access. Testbeds will also be made available to the wider UKRI community and UK public sector research establishments.

### What are the expectations around testbed availability?

ExCALIBUR H&ES testbeds will be highly experimental and we do not expect them to be operated on a service footing.

### What will the resource allocation process be for ExCALIBUR H&ES testbeds?

This will depend to a large extent on the nature and scope of the testbed projects, and may vary from one testbed to another.

### How will people use the testbeds?

In most cases we expect testbeds to be remotely accessible via ssh and similar protocols, using SAFE and/or UK Access Management Federation authentication. 

### What if I am aiming to work on something which is highly sensitive and need the details to be kept secret?

We expect that some projects will be wholly or partly sensitive, e.g. including pre-commercial components for which non-disclosure agreements are likely to apply. Please contact the ExCALIBUR H&ES [programme office](mailto:excalibur-hes@jiscmail.ac.uk?subject=ExCALIBUR%20HES%20website%20enquiry) to discuss, if required.

### What support will ExCALIBUR H&ES be able to provide for my project?

As part of the ExCALIBUR H&ES programme we will be working with technology partners and funded projects to provide training opportunities for the research community. ExCALIBUR H&ES also has some dedicated Research Software Engineering effort, which is focussed on benchmarking at Exascale. 

## Get in touch

If you have any queries or require further information please do get in touch with the Hardware & Enabling Software programme co-directors Prof Simon McIntosh-Smith (University of Bristol) and Revd Dr Jeremy Yates (University College London), and our Project Manager Martin Hamilton (UCL) via our [programme office](mailto:excalibur-hes@jiscmail.ac.uk?subject=ExCALIBUR%20HES%20website%20enquiry). We are happy to discuss and provide formative feedback on draft proposals before they are submitted.
